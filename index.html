			<h1>2017 Donation Impact Report</h1>
			<p>Last year, 2017, was one of the most challenging in our 25-year history with the Trump administration intent on undoing decades of Alaska conservation progress. It was also a year of transition for Alaska Wilderness League, as I took the reigns as executive director in mid-October, succeeding Cindy Shogan who led the organization so capably for the bulk of its history. The enormous threats notwithstanding, it was incredibly gratifying to return to the Alaska arena, fighting alongside such a talented staff and with so many of you who care deeply about the fate of these iconic lands and waters.</p>
			<p>Even with passage of tax legislation last December – a bill that included a mandate for oil leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge – I remain optimistic about our ability to protect this last great wilderness. Because of the passion and generosity of donors, members and supporters like you, we are already setting the stage to block drilling and restore protections for the Arctic Refuge. Your donations, your engagement and your support have strengthened our resolve and commitment. We will not rest, we will not yield and we will not forsake for a moment our responsibility to defend the Arctic Refuge and other irreplaceable, iconic and deeply cherished Alaska land and waters.</p>
			<p>Thank you for being part of the Alaska Wilderness League family, for caring about Alaska’s awe-inspiring wildlife, its majestic landscapes and the indigenous people who depend on them. Thank you for giving us the privilege of working for your conservation interests. Moreover, thank you for making it possible for us to do what we do each day.</p>
			<p>Here’s a snapshot of how we put your generous donations to work in 2017 along with a quick status update on these vital campaigns.</p>

				<h2>Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</h2>
				<p>Unique political circumstances led to the inclusion of an Arctic Refuge leasing provision in December 2017 tax legislation, and yet, the national support for protecting the Arctic Refuge leading up to this unfortunate event will carry forward as our fight continues to restore protections for its “biological heart” – the 1.6 million-acre coastal plain. In 2017, your dollars enabled us to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Block efforts to exempt Arctic Refuge drilling from several major bedrock environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.</li>
						<li>Strengthen, diversify and re-energize the coalition of organizations working to protect the Arctic Refuge, including groups ranging from the Garden Club of America, to leading faith denominations, to scores of outdoor retailers and athletes, to hunting and angling groups.</li>
						<li>Secure opposition from more than a dozen Republican members of Congress as well as Republican luminaries including former Governor of New Jersey and head of the 9/11 Commission Tom Kean, as well as former EPA administrators William Ruckelshaus, William K. Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman.</li>
						<li>Garner 125 House and 40 Senate co-sponsors of legislation that would permanently protect the coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge.</li>
						<li>Elevate the voices of hundreds of Alaskans who support the Arctic Refuge, from guides and outfitters to scientists and Alaska Natives.</li>
						<li>Generate more than 70 letters to the editor and op-eds in a dozen target states as well as several network news stories and features in outlets including the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today and National Public Radio.</li>
						<li>Partner and support our Gwich’in Athabaskan allies by flying their tribal leadership and others to Washington, D.C., throughout the 2017 tax bill fight to visit more than 100 congressional offices.</li>
						<li>Catalyze millions of social media, on-line and other actions for the Arctic Refuge, as well as several Capitol Hill rallies and district-level events across the country.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Current Status (October 2018): The League joined with other NGO and native interests in a lawsuit challenging President Trump's decision to overturn an Executive Order from President Obama protecting 125 million acres of the Arctic Ocean. And, we joined an appeal of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement’s (BSEE) decision to withhold the majority of two Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for documents related to Arctic Ocean lease holdings.</p>
